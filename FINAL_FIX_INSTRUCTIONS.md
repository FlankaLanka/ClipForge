# FINAL FIX - Sprite Sheet Save Issue

## Status: ✅ FIXED - Just Needs Restart

## What Was Wrong
The Rust backend was using Serde's default behavior which converts `snake_case` to `camelCase` during serialization. This caused a mismatch between what the frontend sent and what the backend expected.

## What Was Fixed
Added `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]` to the Rust structs to keep snake_case naming.

## Files Modified
- `src-tauri/src/commands/character_extractor.rs` - Added serde attribute to structs

## Verification
✅ Sprite sheets are being created successfully (checked temp files)
✅ Images are valid PNG files (not corrupt)
✅ Rust code compiles without errors
✅ Frontend code is correct

## YOU MUST RESTART THE APP

The fix is in place, but you're still running the old compiled version. 

### Restart Command:
```bash
cd /Users/flanka/Desktop/clipforge
npm run tauri dev
```

### After Restart:
1. Extract character sprites from your Mario video
2. Click "Choose Save Location" or "Quick Copy to Desktop"
3. The save should work without the `spriteSheetPath` error

## Expected Behavior After Restart
```
✅ Extraction: Works (already working)
✅ Detection: Works (found 7-8 Mario sprites)
✅ Sprite Sheet: Created successfully
✅ Save: Will work after restart
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work
1. Check that you restarted the app (not just refreshed)
2. Check console logs for the exact error
3. Verify the Rust backend was recompiled (check terminal output)

## Technical Details
The issue was at the Rust ↔ JavaScript serialization boundary. Serde was converting parameter names, causing a mismatch. The `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]` attribute tells Serde to preserve the original naming convention.
