# ClipForge - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Phase 3: Advanced Recording Studio** (Completed)
- âœ… Implemented high-resolution 1920x1080 canvas recording system
- âœ… Created professional recording studio with canvas-based sprites
- âœ… Added real-time audio mixing for voice sources
- âœ… Implemented screen capture, webcam capture, and voice recording
- âœ… Built intuitive drag-and-drop sprite management system

## Recent Major Achievements
- âœ… **High-Quality Recording**: 1920x1080 canvas recording at 60 FPS with 20 Mbps video + 256 kbps audio
- âœ… **Canvas Recording System**: Separate high-resolution recording canvas that syncs with display canvas
- âœ… **Audio Integration**: Real-time audio mixing from voice sources using Web Audio API
- âœ… **Smart Sprite Sizing**: Sprites automatically sized to match actual source dimensions
- âœ… **Professional UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with proper resolution indicators
- âœ… **File Management**: User-selectable output folders with timestamped filenames

## Current System Architecture
- **Canvas Preview**: 1920x1080 resolution with responsive scaling
- **Recording Canvas**: Hidden 1920x1080 canvas for high-quality recording
- **Audio Mixing**: Web Audio API for real-time voice source mixing
- **Sprite Management**: Drag, resize, rotate, layer management for all sources
- **Source Types**: Screen capture, webcam capture, voice-only sources
- **Output Format**: WebM/MP4 with VP9/VP8 codec support

## Key Technical Features
