# ClipForge - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
ClipForge addresses the need for a lightweight, fast desktop video editor that doesn't require complex installation or cloud dependencies. Many existing solutions are either too heavy (Adobe Premiere), too limited (basic mobile apps), or require internet connectivity.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Accessibility**: Simple, intuitive interface for basic video editing
2. **Performance**: Native desktop performance with Rust backend
3. **Offline**: No cloud dependencies, works completely offline
4. **Cross-platform**: Single codebase for Windows, macOS, and Linux
5. **Lightweight**: Fast startup and low memory usage

## How It Should Work
- **Import**: Drag & drop or file picker for video files
- **Edit**: Visual timeline with drag-and-drop clip arrangement
- **Record**: Built-in screen and webcam recording
- **Export**: One-click export with quality options
- **Preview**: Real-time video preview during editing

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: No learning curve for basic operations
- **Fast**: Sub-5-second startup, smooth preview playback
- **Reliable**: No crashes during import/export operations
- **Professional**: Clean, modern interface with proper feedback
- **Efficient**: Keyboard shortcuts and streamlined workflows

## Target Users
- Content creators needing quick video edits
- Educators creating instructional videos
- Developers recording screen demos
- Anyone needing basic video editing without complex software
